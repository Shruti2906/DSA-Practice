//204. Count Primes - Leetcode Problem
//Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

//Example
//Input: n = 10
//Output: 4
//Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.

//T.C : 

class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        
        //sieve of Erathosthenes
        //2.start with 2 mark all nos comes in the table of 2 as non-prime numbers.
        //3. repeat step 3 till n-1 (only for prime numbers)
        //4.count prime numbers

        if (n==0) return false;

        int cnt = 0;
        vector<bool> primes(n, true);   //1.mark all nos from 0 till n-1 as prime

        primes[0] = primes[1] = false;

        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){     //start from 2 till n-1     
            if(primes[i]){          //if it is prime (check in our vector)
                cnt++;              //update count
                
                int j = i*2;        //as i is prime check all its multiples till n-1, mark them as non-prime
                while(j < n){
                    primes[j] = false;
                    j += i;
                }
            }
